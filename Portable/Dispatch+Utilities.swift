/**
 Reader Writer queue with first-in priority semantics. Reads occur concurrently and writes serially.
 
 Execution is based on first-in semantics of the queue. i.e. Pending read operations will be exhausted before a write operation occurs
 and subsequent read operations will be held off until a write completes.
 
 - note: Pending read operations may cause unexpected race conditions. If you must ensure that the data
 read is as fresh as possible you may want to consider using the DispatchWriterReader class. The DispatchWriterReader class ensures
 that reads return the most recent data based on their execution time as apposed to their queue order.

 Reader Writer queue with write priority semantics. Reads occur concurrently and writes serially.
 
 Execution is based on write priotity at execution time rather than queue insertion order. i.e. Pending reads 
 that have not begun executing will be held off until all writes occur. This is useful in situations where race conditions
 at execution time must be minimized.
 
 - note: This object incurs more overhead than the DispatchReaderWriter class. Its usefulness is likely limited to
 cases where it is crucial to minimize race conditions when accessing the data.
